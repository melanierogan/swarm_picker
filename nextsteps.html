HTML 

- Hide list ☑️
- As part of event listener, print the random quote in the html ☑️

SCRIPT.JS/JS

- Script should not modify the original list 
- Make list javascript array  done BUT refactor: make this a function (give it a selector it gives you an array)
- function which takes a list and returns random string
- an event listener on the html button that links to funtion (that gets random string)
